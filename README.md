# Gas-Leakage-Detector---Arduino
This project demonstrates a smart way to tackle the gas leakage problem. The gas sensor quickly senses any leakage of gas and according to the level of gas as low, normal, or high and takes corresponding steps simultaneously by notifying the owner through a LCD, and turning ON the servo motor and the buzzer.
