# Gas-Leakage-Detector---Arduino
Author: Areaf

This project demonstrates a smart way to tackle the gas leakage problem. The gas sensor quickly senses any leakage of gas and according to the level of gas as low, normal, or high and takes corresponding steps simultaneously by notifying the owner through a LCD, and turning ON the servo motor and the buzzer. 


As the gas level falls down, the buzzer turns off automatically and the servo motor rotates back to 0 degrees. The display in the LCD changes to read "No gas leakage" respectively.
